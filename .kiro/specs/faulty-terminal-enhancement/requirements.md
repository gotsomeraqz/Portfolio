# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing faulty terminal background effect in the portfolio website by adding more customization options, improved visual effects, and better integration with the overall design system. The enhancement will provide users with a more immersive and visually appealing background experience while maintaining performance and accessibility.

## Glossary

- **FaultyTerminal**: The WebGL-based terminal effect component that renders animated digital patterns
- **BackgroundLayer**: The wrapper component that manages the background effects for the entire portfolio
- **ThemeProvider**: The context provider that manages light/dark theme state
- **PortfolioSite**: The main portfolio website application
- **VisualEffects**: The collection of shader-based rendering effects including glitch, scanlines, and noise

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the faulty terminal background to dynamically respond to my interactions, so that I feel more engaged with the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their mouse over the portfolio, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL create ripple effects that follow the cursor position
2. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL increase the intensity of effects in that region
3. WHEN a user scrolls through different sections, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL subtly adjust its visual parameters to complement the content
4. WHERE mouse interaction is enabled, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL provide smooth interpolation between effect states
5. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL maintain consistent performance during all interactive states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the background effects to adapt to the current theme, so that the visual experience remains cohesive across light and dark modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme changes to dark mode, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL adjust its color palette to complement dark backgrounds
2. WHEN the theme changes to light mode, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL adjust its brightness and contrast for optimal visibility
3. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL provide smooth transitions between theme states without jarring visual changes
4. WHERE custom tint colors are specified, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL blend them appropriately with the current theme
5. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL maintain readability of overlaid content in both theme modes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the terminal background to have varied visual modes, so that I can experience different aesthetic presentations of the same content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL support multiple preset visual modes including retro, modern, and minimal styles
2. WHEN switching between visual modes, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL animate the transition smoothly
3. WHERE performance constraints exist, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL automatically adjust effect complexity
4. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL allow real-time adjustment of key visual parameters including glitch intensity and scan line effects
5. WHERE accessibility preferences are detected, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL reduce motion and flashing effects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want the terminal background to be easily configurable, so that I can customize the visual experience without modifying complex shader code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE BackgroundLayer SHALL provide a simple configuration interface for common visual parameters
2. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL accept configuration through props with sensible default values
3. WHERE configuration changes occur, THE FaultyTerminal SHALL apply them without requiring component remount
4. THE FaultyTerminal SHALL validate configuration parameters and fallback to defaults for invalid values
5. THE BackgroundLayer SHALL support preset configurations for different portfolio sections
